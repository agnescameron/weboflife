# weboflife
cute web implementation of the game of life, used as a frontpage for <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/agnes/index.html">
my website for the course How To Make Almost Anything. Code uses js and html5 canvas, and is very loosely based on 
a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/concannon/sy9py6qa/">js game of life implementation</a> by JSFiddle user Concannon.
